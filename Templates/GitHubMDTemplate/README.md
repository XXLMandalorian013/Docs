## Headings

There are six recognized heading sizes. The largest is Heading 1, the smallest is Heading 6. The # symbol followed by a space and what you want to type is used to create a heading. See below for examples.

```
# first-level heading

## second-level heading

### third-level heading

#### fourth-level heading

##### fifth-level heading

###### sixth-level heading
```

Having multiple ## second-level heading headings will create a table of contents.
