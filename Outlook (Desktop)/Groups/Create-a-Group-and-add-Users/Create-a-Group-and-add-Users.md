# Create a Group and add Users

## Objective:

1. Create a group so all users added to that email group get any email sent to that group's email address. An example would be a sale@domain.com group that would have every sales employee added to it. 

## Prerequisites/Notes:

1. 	1. When adding someone to a group, if you have yet to type their email out in full before or it's not auto-filling when typing, type out the email in full. (email@domain.com)
 
2. This is not an email distribution list, nor is it a shared mailbox. 

## Steps:

1. Select the people button. Then on the pull-down, pick "Group."
