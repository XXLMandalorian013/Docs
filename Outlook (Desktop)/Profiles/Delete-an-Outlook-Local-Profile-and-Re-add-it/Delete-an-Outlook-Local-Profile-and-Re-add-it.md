# Delete an Outlook local profile and re-add it

## Issue: 

![Error](https://github.com/XXLMandalorian013/Docs-Software-SAS-Public/blob/main/Outlook%20(Desktop)/Profiles/Delete-an-Outlook-Local-Profile-and-Re-add-it/images/Error.png)

"The operation failed. The messaging interface have returned an unknown error. If the problem persists, restart Outlook."

## Causes: 

Outlook Profile Corruption due to mailbox nearing maximum retention policy storage limit.


## Notes:

1. If the user has a full mailbox, calendar meetings can take a while to return. 
	
2. You will need to set the signatures back up.

3. If locally managing an Exchange server, make a .pst of the mailbox if you can; if Exchange is MS hosted, no email data will be lost, and delete
the profile w/out creating a .pst.
	
4. Make sure that other mailboxes are signed in and the users knows the login info to re-add them. This also goes for .pst pulled into Outlook.
Ensure you know where those .pst files are saved to view when needed. (make a new .pst if required)
	

## Solution:

Delete the Outlook Profile and recreate it.

## Sections:

## Section Two: Create a new Profile


1. Click "Add," and it will ask you to name the profile. It can be called whatever you want, and click ok.

2. It will then connect to the mail server and ask for your login. Make sure to replace what it pulls in with the full email as it only pulls your initials. Once it connects, click finish.

3. Make sure the new profile you created is selected and click ok

4. Now open Outlook. Pulling all your emails, calendar, and tasks back from the server for you to view will take a bit.
