1. Delete emails to free up Outlook space.

- Other ways to permanently delete items faster

With the message selected, hold Shift and click delete. This will ask if you are sure you want to permanently delete this email

This will send emails to the "recover deleted items" folder. Emails here will no longer be able to be recovered after your retention policy time has 
passed (typically 14 days). Be sure to reference back to steps one and two to truly delete something from your mailbox.
