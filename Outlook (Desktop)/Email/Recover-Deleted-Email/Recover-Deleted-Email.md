# Recover Delete Email

## Prerequisites/Notes:

1. Email deleted from the deleted items folder can be recovered if done so within your default retention policy (typically 14 days) from the time it was deleted.

## Objective:

1. Recover deleted email(s) from the deleted items folder.

## Steps:

1. To recover a deleted email(s) click on the blue link at the top of the Deleted Items folder.

![]()

2. Pick the email(s) you want to restore or select all and make sure "restore selected items" is checked and click "ok". When an email is restored it goes back into the "deleted Items" folder. You may have to do a little digging because when restored, it puts it back in order of date/time on the email not when it was deleted or restored.
